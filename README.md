# Comparison of two approaches to implement and store domain model

The first approach is a classic "Database Driven Design". Code available here `without.aggregate.Main`. Run the code using `sbt without-aggregate/run`.


The second approach is using an aggregate (concept from Domain Driven Design). Code available here `with.aggregate.Main`. Run the code using `sbt with-aggregate/run`.
